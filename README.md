The "Online Orders Analysis" project aims to analyze online sales data to derive insights and inform business decisions using Python and SQL. 
Data will be extracted from a relational database, cleaned, and preprocessed in Python using Pandas.
Descriptive statistics, trend analysis, customer segmentation, and sales forecasting will be performed using libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. 
SQL will be used for efficient data retrieval, and visualizations will be created to present findings. 
The project will result in comprehensive reports, actionable insights, and predictive models to support strategic decision-making in inventory management, marketing, and customer retention.
